IF YOU FIND IT HARD TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION PLEASE READ ON!

We all have done bad things in our life, mistakes and foolish errors. None of us has lived a perfect sinless life.
Therefore God sent His Son Jesus to fulfill that which man couldn't fulfill in his own strenght by keeping the law
of God. Jesus the Son of God gave His life as a ransom so that whoever would go on believing in Him would not perish 
but would go on having eternal life. Because we were too weak and sinful to go to Him, He decided to come to us in flesh,
as a man. This is the Good News of Jesus Christ the Son of God, that you no longer have to try to be perfect,
just accept what the He has for you on the cross and give your life to into His hands and He will work in you to
perfect His character in you!

MAY GOD BLESS YOU AND SHOW MERCY TO YOU!
